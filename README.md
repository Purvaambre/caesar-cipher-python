# Caesar Cipher (Python)

This project is a simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the oldest and most basic encryption techniques.  
It allows the user to **encrypt or decrypt a message** by shifting letters of the alphabet by a fixed number.

This project was created as part of my Python learning journey and helped me understand **string manipulation and encryption logic**.

## 🔐 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in a message by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

Example (Shift = 3):
encoding 
A → D
B → E
C → F

## 🛠 Concepts Used

- `for` loops
- `if / else` conditions
- Strings and indexing
- Modulo operator `%`
- Basic encryption & decryption logic
- User input handling

## ▶️ How the Program Works

1. The user chooses whether to **encrypt** or **decrypt**
2. The user enters a message
3. The user enters a shift number
4. The program shifts each letter accordingly
5. The encrypted or decrypted message is displayed
